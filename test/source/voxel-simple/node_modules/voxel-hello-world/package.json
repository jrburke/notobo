This means that every time you change code in your game you have to build a new bundle in order to test it out. Luckily this is very easy and is automated. When you run the `npm start` script, it runs a local server: when the browser requests `index.js`, it compiles it serverside and then serves up the compiled version.\n\nThe upshot is, as long as you're running the `npm start` script in the background, you can save your changes to index.js and reload the game to see the new code in action, without having to have a build step in between. (If you'd like to change the start script, it's contained in the `package.json` file in the root directory.)\n\n## license\n\nBSD\n",
