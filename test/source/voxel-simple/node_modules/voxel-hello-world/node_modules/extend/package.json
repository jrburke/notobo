  "readme": "# extend() for Node.js\n\n`node-extend` is a port of the classic extend() method from jQuery. It behaves as you expect. It is simple, tried and true.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis package is available on [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) as: `extend`\n\n``` sh\nnpm install extend\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n**Syntax:** extend **(** [`deep`], `target`, `object1`, [`objectN`] **)** \n\n*Extend one object with one or more others, returning the modified object.*\n\nKeep in mind that the target object will be modified, and will be returned from extend().\n\nIf a boolean true is specified as the first argument, extend performs a deep copy, recursively copying any objects it finds. Otherwise, the copy will share structure with the original object(s).\nUndefined properties are not copied. However, properties inherited from the object's prototype will be copied over.\n\n### Arguments\n\n* `deep` *Boolean* (optional)  \nIf set, the merge becomes recursive (i.e. deep copy).\n* `target`\t*Object*  \nThe object to extend.\n* `object1`\t*Object*  \nThe object that will be merged into the first.\n* `objectN` *Object* (Optional)  \nMore objects to merge into the first.\n\n## License\n\n`node-extend` is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nAll credit to the jQuery authors for perfecting this amazing utility.\n\nPorted to Node.js by [Stefan Thomas](https://github.com/justmoon) with contributions by [Jonathan Buchanan](https://github.com/insin).\n",
