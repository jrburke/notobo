  "readme": "glMatrix\n=======================\n\nJavascript has evolved into a language capable of handling realtime 3D graphics, \nvia WebGL, and computationally intensive tasks such as physics simulations.\nThese types of applications demand high performance vector and matrix math,\nwhich is something that Javascript doesn't provide by default.\nglMatrix to the rescue!\n\nglMatrix is designed to perform vector and matrix operations stupidly fast! By\nhand-tuning each function for maximum performance and encouraging efficient\nusage patterns through API conventions, glMatrix will help you get the most out\nof your browsers Javascript engine.\n\nLearn More\n----------------------\nFor documentation, news, tutorials, and more visit the [glMatrix Homepage](http://glmatrix.net/)",
