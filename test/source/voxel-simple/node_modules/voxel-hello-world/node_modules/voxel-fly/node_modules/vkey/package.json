  "readme": "# vkey\n\nvirtual `keyCode` to human name mapping. let's team up to quash all of the `keyCode` inconsistencies that we can!\n\n```javascript\n\nvar vkey = require('vkey')\n\ndocument.body.addEventListener('keydown', function(ev) {\n  console.log(vkey[ev.keyCode])\n}, false)\n\n```\n\ncobbled together from [Benvie's Keyboard](https://github.com/Benvie/Keyboard) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/KeyboardEvent).\n\n## contributing / making life better for everyone\n\n**Step 1**: get the repo and run the test site.\n\n```bash\n$ git clone git://github.com/chrisdickinson/vkey.git\n$ cd vkey.git\n$ npm install --dev .\n$ npm start\n$ # open localhost:3030\n\n```\n\n**Step 2**: open the site in all the browsers you have at your command!\nmash keys! note inconsistencies!\n\n**Step 3**: open an issue with:\n\n1. your operating system\n2. the browser + version\n3. (as best as you can describe), what kind of keyboard you're using. images welcome! crude drawings of keyboards less welcome, but still a little welcome.\n4. what key you pressed\n5. what result you expected\n6. what result you got\n\n**Step 3, HARD MODE**: open a pull request with all of the above, and a minimally invasive fix!\n\n## deviations thus far\n\n* meta left and right are reduced to <meta>, because no one really seems to support it correctly.\n* <unk> is coerced to <menu> on OSX, since it has no idea what that button is (using a dell keyboard.)\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n",
